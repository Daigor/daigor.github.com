heading : Setting up a Video/Audio Recorder on your webcam

<p>
Accessing a users webcam via the browser to produce a streamable source isn't something that works in all browsers without a plugin(Internet explorer). Adding a recorder on top of that and it works in even less browsers. That being said, it was something I wanted to implement for one of my projects to enhance user experience.

Accessing a users camera can be done by the getUserMedia function. This function allows you to do three things. Specify whether you want to get video data from the webcam and/or audio. Asks for permission from the user for access to the hardware. A error function in case the user does not grant permission to use hardware.

Once you have access to user hardware, you can hook up a html video tag to the stream produced by the Web Cam. The code to do it is shown below
