The N-queens problem is a well known puzzle in the computer science world. The goal is to find the number of ways you can place N number of queens on a NxN board without killing each other. The problem becomes exponentially tougher as the board size increases. At the current time of this post, I believe the world record algorithm is N = 27. Sadly, this post isn't going to be about the world breaking solution, but a different solution using bitwise operators. To explore this method, it would be best to start with binary numbers.
</p>
 
<p>
In binary, base-2 world, 0 is “0”, 1 is “1”, and 10 is “2” because 10 = 1 * 21 + 0 * 20, or 2. To represent a base-10 “43”, this would look like 00101011, or 0 * 27 + 0 * 26 + 1 * 25 + 0 * 24 + 1 * 23 + 0 * 22 + 1 * 21 + 1 * 20. Binary numbers can be mapped and look quite similar to rows on a chessboard. The number 16 in binary is "10000". Similar to placing a queen down on the left-most column in a row of a 5x5 chessboard.
</p>

<p>
The first step to solving the N queens problem is mapping out the parameters of the problem. Each time you place down a queen, there are 4 possible conflicts that can happen before placing the next. A row, column, major, and minor diagonal conflict. The row conflict is automatically accounted for due to most algorithms recursively calling the function on the next row. This leaves the column, major, andminor diagonal conflicts.</p>

<p>
At this point I would suggest drawing a table similar to the one I provided above for a 5x5 board for multiple scenarios. There are a fewimportant things to note: 
</p>
<ul id="list">
  <li>The conflicts are maps for where you can place queens on the next row. The idea is to combine all three conflicts to determine a safe spot to place a queen on the next row.</li>
  
  <li>The minor and major diagonal conflicts run in a specific pattern. A major/minor diagonal conflict is determined by where you place the queen combined with the previous rows major/minor diagonal conflict SHIFTED in a specific direction. (Majors shift the x's right and minors shift left).</li>
  
  <li>A full column conflict of all x's can only happen when a queen is placed in every column, resulting in a solved board.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Next would be the binary operators and their general uses. The bitwise operators used this implementation of N-queens is &, |, ^, ~, and the shift operators >> / <<. Here are a few examples and some tips I picked up regarding these operators.
</p>

<ul id="list">
  <li> OR "|" operator is generally used to combine bits. For example 01101 | 10000 would equate to 11101. This gives us a way to combine all our conflicts to determine which slots are open</li>
  <li> AND "&" operator can be used to hide or mask certain bits. & of two numbers only returns bits in which both have a 1. For example 01100 & 01000 would equate to 01000. </li>
  <li>
    The left << and right >> shift operators shift bits in the left or right direction respectively. In this case it'll be used to shift major/minor diagonal conflicts as we go to the next row.
  </li>
  <li>NOT "~" operator inverts inverts the bits of a number. For example ~01100 would equate to 10011. 
  </li>
  <li>
    XOR "^" returns bits where only one has the bit but not the other. An example would be 01011 ^ 11011 would equate to 10000
  </li>
  <li>
    Although it is not a bitwise operator. An important thing to note about negative binary numbers is that they are the inverse of its positive counterpart plus one. For example, 30 is (11110), while -30 is 00001 + 1 or 00010. This follows the two's compliment principle way of encoding negative numbers so that addition of binary numbers still work. For more information here's a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two%27s_complement">link</a> to the wikipedia page. 
  </li>
</ul>

 Now for the actual code!
