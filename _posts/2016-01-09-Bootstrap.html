Cascading Style Sheets and I have a quite the relationship. I spend hours scouring google just to make things look the way I want for a specific project, only to forget everything and repeat the same process for the next project. I always leave CSS for last, going with the mentality of implementing functionality over design and hoping things magically look okay without CSS at the end (never happens). However, recently I've been shown some pretty nifty CSS frameworks.
</p>

CSS frameworks like Bootstrap, Materialize, and Foundation bring a whole new field of styling for me. Some people hate them, stating that its somewhat akin to learning another language and more hassel than its worth. Personally, I find them great and quite easy to use. Bootstrap and Foundation have several templates and  widgets/gadgets pre-made and ready for copy and pasting. I've always been better at reading through code and changing styles as needed, rather than generating templates from a blank sheet and hoping they all fit well. Here are a few reasons to use CSS frameworks.

  <li>
    Responsiveness - Using Bootstrapâ€™s ready made classes, you can specify how many spots in the grid system you want each column to occupy. Then, you can specify at which point you want your columns to stack horizontally rather than vertically to display properly on mobile devices. This is especially useful in mobile ready websites since they dynamically adjust to proper screen resolution.
  </li>

    Speed - As said above, Bootstrap provides you with ready made blocks of code for any design related component you need. There are also bootstrap themes available to cut down time on producing any website. 
  </li>
  <li>
    Support- There is a huge community base behind CSS frameworks. Usually a simple google fix for any problems you run into is all it takes. 
  </li>
</ul>

  Overall, if CSS tends to bog you down I'd take a look at CSS frameworks. Fair warning though, DON'T try to use more than one CSS framework at a time, it leads to unwanted results. Here are a few free Bootstrap and Materialize template designs to get you started.
