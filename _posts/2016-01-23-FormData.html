API's are something all programmers have to deal with. When an API is well documented with examples and/or easy to use, you get a vast resource of information by simply typing in one line of code. Other times, it can lead to frustration when you don't know why its rejecting your request. One of the things I've learned recently when trying to make a request to a server is the FormData object.

My story starts by reading through documentation of a particular API, which seemed simple and easy to use. I submit a post request to a url with video file as an argument. My initial instinct is to just make a request and pass an object with a file key along with the file as the value. I submit it and consistently get a 400 BAD Request with data saying I'm not sending the correct data. I go through the usual debuggers question and console log my file, make sure all my async functions are in order, and google for any reasons as to why it would not work. The error didn't come from not sending the value of my file, but the object that was wrapping it.

FormData objects are a specific type of object that allows you to compile key/value pairs to send during an XMLHttpRequest. It's primary use is to send in form data, mainly Files and Blobs (yeah blobs).
