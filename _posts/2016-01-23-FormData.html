heading : Using Postman with Streamable API

<p>
API's are something all programmers have to deal with. When an API is well documented with examples and/or easy to use, you get a vast resource of information by simply typing in one line of code. Other times, it can lead to frustration when you don't know why its rejecting your request. One of the things I've learned recently when trying to make a request to a server is the FormData object.

Streamable API allows anyone to upload a video with a POST request and will host your video on their network for free. An example of their API is shown here.</p>

<p> Generally, the first few steps is to test the url with test data to ensure everything comes back correctly. A quick way to test API's is to use <a href='https://www.getpostman.com/'>Postman</a>. I've shown a screenshot below of me sending an example POST request to Streamable API.

And here is the response from Streamable

As you can see, according to Streamable API, it was a successful response and I was able to recieve a shortcode to poll for the correct video URL later. So how does this translate to code? Well as you can see, we submitted form-data with a key 'file' and the value being a file we choose. <a href='https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FormData'>FormData</a> is a very specific type of object in which you can append key value pairs. A sample snippet of the request using the Axios, a promise based http client for browser/node is shown below.
