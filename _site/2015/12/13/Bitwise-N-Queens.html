The N-queens problem is a well known puzzle in the computer science world. The goal is to find the number of ways you can place N number of queens on a NxN board. The picture above shows a one of ten possible solutions for a 5x5 board.

The problem becomes exponentially tougher as the board size increases. At the current time of this post, I believe the world record algorithm is N = 27. Sadly, this post isn't going to be about the world breaking solution, but a different solution using bitwise operators. I'll be honest, I couldn't even imagine a way to solve this problem using bitwise operators, nor did I have enough understanding of binary numbers and operators to even start.

<p>
Long story short, I did what any reasonable person would do, I googled it. One of the first solutions I came across was a recursive call to 10 lines of code containing one while loop. At first glance, it didn't look so bad. I figured I could dissect 10 lines of code no problem, boy was I wrong.
