I'm currently a student at Hack Reactor Remote program and before that, I attended the Hack Reactor student on-site program. Long story short, I was injured midway through the on-site program and had to drop out. On the bright side, I am able to solidify my understanding of programming concepts much better the second time around. As far as I'm concerned, it's been a blessing in disguise since I get to meet awesome people and see both programs at Hack Reactor. It's amazing how much I've retained and how much more I'm still learning everyday. I feel enabled to try things I was never able to before.

This blog is a perfect example of something I wouldn't have considered setting up my first go around. I've never considered myself a creative writer, nor did I feel the need to jot down what I learned. However, making my own blog from scratch has already become a lesson in itself. I became captivated in the functionality and seemingly smooth transitions of other blogs I came across. Hopefully this blog will become a platform to enhance my learning and development, or at the very least a collection of all the shenanigans in my life.
