        <p>So this is what it's feels like to blog. I'm currently a student at Hack Reactor Remote program and before that... I was a Hack Reactor student on-site. Due to an unfortunate accident, I ended up going through Hack reactor a second time. So here I am blogging about my experience and a few of my adventures / shenanigans along the way. LETS GOOOOO </p>
